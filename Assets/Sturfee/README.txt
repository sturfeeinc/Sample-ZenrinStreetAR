Sturfee VPS SDK
version 1.4.4b1

The SturfeeVPS SDK provides functionality for building immersive outdoor AR experiences. 
Using Sturfee's proprietary Visual Processing System (VPS), the SDK can provide precise localization (position and orientation) through imagery from the device camera.
The VPS provides better accuracy than GPS for localization in geospatial coordinates.
